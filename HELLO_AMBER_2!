Hello!

So this friday I have :
> tested the parser and everything I tested passed. YOUPIII!    OK
> cleaned, reordered and normed the parser                      OK
> made the last signal work (SIGQUIT in children). YOUPIIII!    OK
    Thanks to Thomas (again... :D) : it did not work for children 
    because if we use the SIG_IGN... Well the signal is ignored 
    from now on. With sigaction we tell the program what to do 
    with the SIGQUIT so we just tell it to "not print" the ^\
    and that's it! Then we can tell him what we want for the children

> when we press ctrl+C or ctrl+\ after a builtin that is forked
(for exemple echo), the signal does not behave like we want to: I think
it's because we don't exit the builtin/child process
