Hello!

So this friday I have :
> tested the parser and everything I tested passed. YOUPIII!             OK
> cleaned, reordered and normed the parser                               OK
> made the last signal work (SIGQUIT in children). YOUPIIII!             OK
    Thanks to Thomas (again... :D) : it did not work for children 
    because if we use the SIG_IGN... Well the signal is ignored 
    from now on. With sigaction we tell the program what to do 
    with the SIGQUIT so we just tell it to "not print" the ^\
    and that's it! Then we can tell him what we want for the children

We still have a few problems though :(
> when we press ctrl+C or ctrl+\ after a builtin that is forked         NOT OK
    (for exemple echo), the signal does not behave like we want to: 
    I think it's because we don't exit the builtin/child process.
> when we try to show the exit_code with "echo $?" in the parent        NOT OK
    process, we get 0 everytime, I figured we might have to work 
    with another global variable (we can do a structure) to be able
    to update the exit_code from the handler.

    the good exit_code for the children: I absolutely don't know why 
    (as it's working when we exit normally and also with errors like 
    "command not found"!...). Thomas has tried to help me on that one
    too but he doesn't get it either :(.

    be quick and easy !
